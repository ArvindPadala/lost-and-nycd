# lost-and-nycd
"Lost &amp; NYC’d" is a poetic urban lost-and-found oracle. Using Moondream’s lightweight model, it scans NYC sidewalks for lost-looking items (gloves, phones, umbrellas, etc.) and weaves together object type, location, and public datasets to predict who lost it, how urgent recovery is, and what story it tells.
